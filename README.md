# Air-Quality-Prediction-Using-Supervised-Machine-Learning
* Objective: My main goal is to create a Machine learning model and investigate the Air Quality index by predicting the best results from various machine learning algorithms based on precision.
* Analysis: With analysis I got to know about Air Quality Index (AQI), which is a measure of how air pollution affects oneâ€™s health with in a short period of time.
   * I can use some software requirements those are:
      * Operating System: Windows8/10 
      * Coding Language: Python
      * Coding Platform: Jupyter Notebook
      * Version: Python 3.6.8 
      * IDE: Python 3.6.8 IDLE
      * Packages: numpy, pandas, Sklearn , Flask ,PymySql.
* Model built: I can Build a model using Random Forest Algorithm (Supervised Algorithm) which works on user input.
* Result: finally I got The accuracy of the model is 81.64% by using Random forest Regressor algorithm
* Usecase: The model outcome could help to predict the air quality on the basis of AQI value.i developed a model that is capable of predicting most accurate results of a particular area.finally I
can conclude that
  * Predicting Air Quality Index using Machine Learning is easy to implement. 
  * It reduces the time and manual work.
  * It includes taking input as different pollutants and displays the level of air quality.
